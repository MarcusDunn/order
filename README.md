# order
a very simple dependantly typed language

I'm using this to learn compilers. It will be 90% a disaster but hopfuly I'll learn something interesting along the way.
I'll be overjoyed if I get a sound dependant type system that compiles to machine code. Speed, Syntax, Cleaness of implementation,
and Useablility are all incedental.

Current working thoughts are following the noble functional tradition of stealing haskells syntax and trying to inject dependant types into it.
