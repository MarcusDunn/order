# Order
![Build](https://github.com/MarcusDunn/order/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)

Rust is hard so go check out https://github.com/MarcusDunn/depends where I don't get abused by the borrow checker

a parser, a type checker, and an interpreter for a language implementing [Martin-LÃ¶f type theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intuitionistic_type_theory) (hopefully)

## Goals (WIP)

- [ ] Parser
- [ ] Type Checker
- [ ] Interpreter
- [ ] Sound
- [ ] Well Tested

## Non-Goals (we're nailing these)

- [x] being at at all useful
- [x] good error messages
- [x] smart language design
- [x] running speed
- [X] IO
